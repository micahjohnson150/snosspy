INTRODUCTION
============
SNOSSPY is a python implementation of the Snow Slope Stability model originally
put forth by Conway and Wilbur in 1999

Since then there have been several applications of the model but none have been
in a spatial context. Here SNOSS is applied spatially using the Spatial
Resources Modeling Framework (SMRF) that was began by Dr. Scott Havens in late
2015. Here the data generate by SMRF is used to force the SNOSS model.

INSTALLATION
============
SNOSSPY requires the docker to run the SMRF. Please visit LINK to DOCKER

Now install the python requirements by:

..code-block:

  pip install -r requirements.txt


USAGE
